# Class Work

## Exercises

Exercises are not marked. They are an opportunity for you to practice the material from class while getting support from the professor and peers.

>NOTE1: If you get stuck, you can reach out to fellow students and the professor. You will benefit most from this exercise is you first try on your own before seeking help. Trying to work through issues is how you develop your problem solving skills.

>NOTE2: I will be looking for evidence that you've completed the exercises when determining your final class participation grade and repository management grade.



### Exercise2

Write a program called line_counter.py that counts the number of lines found in a text file and prints this to the screen. The program should accept one command argument, the file you want to count lines within.

Ex:
```
$python line_counter.py input_e2.txt 
The file input_e2.txt has 12 lines
```

### Exercise3

Using MS Excel (or other spreadsheet software), create a spreadsheet with three columns (header should be Num1, Num2 and Num3) and 4 rows rows of numbers (just choose any numbers you want, mix it up a little bit). Save this file as a csv file (called input_e2.csv) in your exercises directory.

Create a program called sum_file.py that reads input_e2.csv file . It should output a file named output_e2.csv with a fourth column that is the addition of the three numbers. The input file will have the header Num1, Num2, Num3 -- and the output file will have the header Num1, Num2, Num3, Sum.

### Exercise4

Create a file with random text in it. Add three email addresses to the file at random locations within it. Save it as input_e2.txt.

Write a program called email_find.py that searches this file and lists any email addresses found with it.

### Exercise5

In this program you will use the encryption scheme found in the WordScramble program.

Create a program called encrypt.py that accepts a three filenames as command line  arguments.

This program will encrypt all content of the first file and store it in a file called by the second supplied filename, and finally store the key (the mapping between letters and the encoded (scramble) letters) in the third supplied filename.

 example usage
```
  python encrypt.py input.txt output.txt key.txt
```
> NOTE: Study the solution posted by the professor. Try to recreate it yourself. Make sure you understand how it works.
